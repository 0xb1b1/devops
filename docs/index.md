# 0xb1b1's DevOps Guides

## What is this website?

This website is designed to help you learn how to become a DevOps engineer. Please note that this website mainly consists of my own notes that are the direct result of experimentation and my hands-on practice.

## What do you write about?

Mostly about system administration and container orchestration. I use GNU/Linux and OSX, and henceforth, if even applicable, commands/guides for Windows may not be accurate and/or up-to-date. If you have any ideas/improvements, please consult the following part of this page.

## How to contribute?

First of all, thanks! If you wish to contribute, please open a PR in the Git repository for this website. It can be found in the top right section of the page!
